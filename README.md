# Symptom Checker Module - Medical App

## 📌 Overview
The **Symptom Checker Module** is an essential functionality within the Medical App, designed to assist patients in evaluating their health condition. Using a simple **Yes/No health questionnaire**, it determines if a patient requires urgent medical attention or if they can proceed to a **self-diagnosis panel** for possible conditions and remedies.

## 🏥 How It Works
1. **General Health Questionnaire**
   - The patient answers **10 yes/no general health questions** related to their symptoms.
   - If the patient answers **7 or more 'Yes' responses**, they are flagged as being in a serious condition.
   - The system directs them to **book an appointment** with a doctor for further evaluation.
   
2. **Symptom Checker Panel**
   - If the patient has **less than 7 'Yes' responses**, they are taken to a panel where they can manually input their symptoms.
   - The system processes the symptoms and provides a **likely diagnosis**.
   - It also suggests **remedies** based on common treatments.
   
## 🛠️ Features
- **Interactive Health Assessment**: 10-question Yes/No format for quick evaluation.
- **Smart Triage System**: Redirects users to book an appointment if symptoms indicate a serious condition.
- **Symptom Input Panel**: Allows users to describe their symptoms in text.
- **AI-Powered Diagnosis**: Suggests possible conditions based on the symptoms entered.
- **Home Remedies & Treatments**: Provides recommendations like medications or natural remedies (e.g., "Constant sneezing might indicate sinus issues; try warm lemon water or sinus relief pills").
